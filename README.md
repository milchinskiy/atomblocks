* install rustup:
  ```sh
  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
  ```

* install stable rust and cargo:
  ```sh
  rustup install stable
  ```

### Build from sources

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/milchinskiy/atomblocks.git && cd ./atomblocks
   ```
2. Build release
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

### Install from crates.io
```sh
cargo install atomblocks
```


### Install from AUR (Arch Linux)

using `yay`, `paru` or any other AUR helper you prefer, yay for example:

```sh

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

An incredibly simple and straightforward configuration file can be found in the code repository [sample/config.toml](sample/config.toml)
There are a few places where configuration could live

* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/atomblocks/config.toml
* `$HOME`/.config/atomblocks/config.toml
* /etc/atomblocks/config.toml
* you can directly set the file via args


### Run

```sh
atomblocks run
```

### Manually hit the block to update

```sh
atomblocks hit <ID>
# where <ID> is a sequential block index in config file
```

### Run with custom config

```sh
atomblocks run --config ./my-custom-config.toml
```
